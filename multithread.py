'''
This script provides a generic solution to multithreading a process used in a PyQt application,
to prevent the graphical interface from being unresponsive to end user's interactions.
It is heavily borrowed from a nice example by Martin Fitzpatrick at
https://martinfitzpatrick.name/article/multithreading-pyqt-applications-with-qthreadpool/
To use, import it into an empty script and sub-class QMainWindow for the GUI frontend design.
